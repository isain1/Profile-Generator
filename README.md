# Profile-Generator

## Description

This is a Node.js application that accepts user input to create a team's profile. First the user is prompted for the managers name and some other basic information about them, then the user is prompted with a menu that has the option to add an engineer, an intern or to finish building the team. If the user selects an engineer or intern they are prompted for some information about them and then they are taken back to the menu with options to add another team member or finish building team. This gives the user tthe opportunity to add as many interns or engineers as they would like. Upon selecting "finish building team" the application then creates an html file thatt renders cards for each team member that the user created.
